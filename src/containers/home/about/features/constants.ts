    info: 'We are developing the science to address two critical questions that must be answered to realize the potential of natural climate solutions: Precisely where should we focus our efforts, and exactly what interventions have the highest likelihood of success?  Research has shown how much nature can do: forests, agricultural lands, grasslands and wetlands can cost-effectively capture 11 billion metric tons of CO2e per year, a full third of the solution needed to stabilize our climate by 2030. We are delivering covering a broad field of study: avoided forest conversion, climate-smart forestry, reforestation and agroforestry, agriculture and grasslands, blue carbon and peatlands. When complete, each playbook will include maps that show the largest climate mitigation opportunities per hectare of investment; operational protocols and methodologies to ensure projects achieve measurable climate mitigation; and on-the-ground research that fills critical knowledge gaps.',

    info: 'Building of the expertise of on-the-ground practitioners to help activate natureâ€™s potential to limit climate change we are developing a global NCS Prototyping Network to field test and evaluate high-impact NCS strategies that can be scaled and replicated around the world.  The network brings together field staff and scientists from 15 existing TNC projects using NCS interventions in peatlands, coastal wetlands, and agroforestry systems. Each project is a means to field test the impact and efficacy of different approaches. Local project teams will work with the prototyping team to: Measure mitigation and evaluate project impact. Assess other key factors relating to feasibility, such as costs, co-benefits to people and nature, and equitable implementation; and Identify challenges, conditions for success, and opportunities to scale. The network will also provide a cross-project community of learning and collaboration, and a constant feedback loop to improve implementation through adaptive management. Data and case studies from prototype projects will be available to researchers and decision-makers around the world through a new NCS Action Mapper and integrated into a set of playbooks for employing different NCS strategies.',
