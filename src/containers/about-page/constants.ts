    question: 'What are natural climate solutions?',
    answer:
      '<p>Natural climate solutions (NCS) are actions to <b>protect, better manage</b> and <b>restore</b> nature to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and store carbon. Science shows that— if deployed alongside other rapid decarbonisation efforts such as cutting fossil-fuel use and accelerating renewable energy—NCS can deliver a third of the emission reductions needed by 2030 to help us avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p>',
  },
  {
    question: 'How are natural climate solutions different from Nature-based solutions?',
    answer:
      'Natural climate solutions are a subset of Nature-based solutions (NbS) that are focused on climate mitigation benefits. We have continued to use the term NCS to denote the specific accounting framework we have developed but encourage substituting the term NbS, or simply “nature,” as useful and appropriate for the audience.',

    question: 'How is naturebase different from other platforms?',
    answer:
      'While many existing platforms serve the purpose of monitoring and reporting of progress around different natural ecosystems, such as the tracking of deforestation rates, naturebase focuses on identifying opportunities to protect, restore and sustainably manage nature to reduce the impacts of climate change. The platform offers users the largest database of peer-reviewed science on natural climate solutions, combined with additional resources such as co-benefits, policies, and financing. It also includes all identified activities for natural climate solutions at the global, national and subnational levels. Naturebase is designed not as a replacement but as an additional resource to supplement existing data and tools.',

    answer:
      'Indigenous People and local communities (IPLC) steward a quarter of the world’s lands and 80% of the world’s biodiversity. Naturebase intends to both respect and support these communities in their own pursuit of informed and self-determined climate and land use decision-making. The platform features a new NCS Human Rights Toolset specially designed to help screen existing and proposed projects for ongoing or potential future risks to human rights and agency. Further, sensitive data such as land tenure will not be publicly shared, conforming with principles of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC).',

    question: 'Who is funding naturebase?',
    answer:
      'In 2020, the Bezos Earth Fund pledged a $10 billion fund over a decade to fight the impact of climate change. The Nature Conservancy received a portion of this gift to dramatically expand the scientific tools needed to take natural climate solutions to scale, across the globe. The funding is also focused on building equitable solutions that benefit communities impacted by climate change by engaging diverse community stakeholders, indigenous leadership, and others.',

    question: 'Which data sources does naturebase use?',
    answer: '',
  },
  {
    question: 'How recent is the data and how often is it updated?',
    answer:
      'Pathway data represent the latest and most accurate estimations of the mitigation potential associated with each dataset. These estimations may be subject to regular updates, which are influenced by various factors including advancements in global scientific knowledge, such as changes in emissions factors or available global extent data, and will be different for each dataset.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How are the numbers calculated?',
    answer:
      'The methodology to calculate the mitigation potential will vary per pathway. However, each will include the combination of geospatial data combined with emissions estimations. Climate mitigation potential will either be expressed as increased sequestration for restoration pathways (usually expressed in units of metric tons of carbon sequestered per year), avoided loss based on historic conversion (usually expressed in units of metric tons of carbon per hectare) for the protect pathways, or the increased sequestration or reduced emissions due to improved management practices for the manage pathways.',
