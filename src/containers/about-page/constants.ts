    question: 'What are natural climate solutions?',
    answer:
      '<p>Natural climate solutions (NCS) are actions to <b>protect, better manage</b> and <b>restore</b> nature to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and store carbon. Science shows that— if deployed alongside other rapid decarbonization efforts such as cutting out fossil-fuel use and accelerating renewable energy—nature can help us avoid the worst impacts of climate change and deliver a third of the emission reductions needed by 2030.</p>',
  },
  {
    question: 'How are natural climate solutions different from Nature-based solutions?',
    answer:
      'Natural climate solutions are a subset of Nature-based solutions (NbS) that are focused on climate mitigation benefits. We have continued to use the term NCS to denote the specific accounting framework we have developed but encourage substituting the term NbS, or simply “nature,” as useful and appropriate for the audience.',

    question: 'How is naturebase different from other platforms?',
    answer:
      'While many existing platforms serve the purpose of monitoring and reporting of progress around different natural ecosystems, such as the tracking of deforestation rates, naturebase focuses on identifying opportunities to protect, restore and sustainably manage nature to reduce the impacts of climate change. Our platform offers the largest database of peer-reviewed science on natural climate solutions, combined with additional resources such as co-benefits, policies, and financing. It also includes all identified activities for natural climate solutions at the global, national and subnational levels.',

      '<div><p>Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLC) steward a quarter of the world’s lands and 80% of the world’s biodiversity. We recognize that IPLCs are the true stewards of lands and waters – and have been deploying natural climate solutions since time immemorial.

    question: 'Who is funding naturebase?',
    answer:
      'In 2020, the Bezos Earth Fund pledged a $10 billion fund over a decade to fight the impact of climate change. The Nature Conservancy received a portion of this gift to dramatically expand the scientific tools needed to take natural climate solutions to scale, across the globe. The funding is also focused on building equitable solutions that benefit communities impacted by climate change by engaging diverse community stakeholders, indigenous leadership, and others.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which data sources does naturebase use?',
    answer:
      'The specific methodology and input data used to calculate the mitigation potential will vary among pathways, but all adhere to the core principles of natural climate solutions. Each spatial datasets presented here estimate the mitigation potential of Natural Climate Solution activities derived from original geospatial analysis using the latest satellite and peer-reviewed datasets of current land systems, varied geospatial data, and carbon emissions/sequestration estimates informed by a review of peer-reviewed publications. For more information see our data download section.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How recent is the data and how often is it updated?',
    answer:
      'The pathway data represents the latest and most accurate estimations of the mitigation potential associated with each dataset. These estimations may be subject to updates, influenced by advancements in global scientific knowledge, changes in emissions factors or available global extent data, and will differ for each dataset.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do we express climate mitigation potential ?',
    answer:
      'Climate mitigation potential will either be expressed as increased sequestration for restoration pathways (usually expressed in units of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestered per year), avoided loss based on historic conversion (usually expressed in units of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per hectare) for the protect pathways, or the increased sequestration or reduced emissions due to a combination for improved management practices for the manage pathways.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the baseline that’s being assumed for the pathway data?',
    answer:
      'The baseline used for each pathway is dependent on each specific dataset. Accounting horizons will be standardized for each pathway for the years 2035 and 2050. All data assumptions and caveats are indicated in the individual methodology sections and will vary per dataset. For more information on the pathways, consult the data download section.',
