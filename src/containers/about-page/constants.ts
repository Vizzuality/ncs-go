    question: 'What are natural climate solutions?',
    answer:
      'Natural climate solutions (NCS) are actions to protect, better manage and restore nature to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and store carbon. Science shows that— if deployed alongside other rapid decarbonisation efforts such as cutting fossil-fuel use and accelerating renewable energy—NCS can deliver a third of the emission reductions needed by 2030 to help us avoid the worst impacts of climate change.',
