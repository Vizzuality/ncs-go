                Nature can deliver up to one-third of the mitigation solutions that are required to
                stabilize the planet whilst also providing ecosystem and human well-being benefits
                such as improving water and air quality, public health and building communities that
                are resilient to extreme weather events such as flooding and drought.

                Knowing where, why and how to deploy these interventions is critical to unlocking
