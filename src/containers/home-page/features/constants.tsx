          We are developing the science to address two critical questions that must be answered to
          realize the potential of Natural Climate Solutions: Precisely where should we focus our
          efforts, and exactly what interventions have the highest likelihood of success? Research
          has shown how much nature can do: forests, agricultural lands, grasslands and wetlands
          cost-effectively capture 11 billion metric tons of CO2e per year, a full third of the
          solution needed to stabilize our climate by 2030.{' '}

          NCS are divided into over twenty different pathways to action, including avoided forest
          conversion, climate-smart forestry, reforestation and agroforestry, regenerative
          agriculture, and protection or restoration of grasslands, peatlands and coastal wetlands.
          Naturebase will map out of these pathways at high resolution, specifying where the largest
          climate mitigation opportunities occur, and under what conditions. It will highlight
          operational protocols and methodologies to ensure projects achieve measurable climate
          mitigation. And it will showcase on-the-ground research that fills critical knowledge
          gaps.

            Natural climate solutions (NCS) practitioners must take bold steps to ensure that
            projects not only avoid adverse human rights impacts but actively promote Indigenous
            People and Local Communities (IPLC) rights, self-determination, well-being, and equity,
            including full entitlement to benefits. The broader NCS community must strive to do this
            not only because it is the right thing to do, but also because it will ensure the
            long-term viability and sustainability of NCS projects. This{' '}

          Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) can deliver benefits to biodiversity, human adaptation to
          climate change, and human well-being in addition to their carbon mitigation benefit.
          Understanding how these additional benefits vary by NCS intervention, local context,
          population, country, and other factors is critical to identifying areas where NCS
          implementation can have the greatest outcomes and tradeoffs. We are systematically
          identifying the evidence-base on additional NCS benefits, generating new evidence on the
          biodiversity, adaptation, and human well-being co-benefits for NCS interventions.
        </p>
        <p>We are doing this through multiple interrelated projects including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Showing the ranked impact of several NCS pathways on seven ecosystem services: nitrogen
            retention, sediment retention, water quality, pollination, coastal protection, green
            water storage, and water availability.
          </li>
          <li>
            A machine learning-based systematic evidence map of more than 200,000 scientific
            articles on the biodiversity and human well-being co-benefits of NCS – Coming soon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Estimating the global contribution of several NCS pathways to improving and maintaining
            landscape connectivity – Coming soon.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, these products provide foundational evidence needed by decision-makers to
          determine whether and how NCS implementation serves as an instrumental tool in advancing
          the well-being of both nature and people.

          We have a unique opportunity to drive significant political commitment and finance towards
          sustainable land-use on a livable planet. Governments have the power to unlock the
          incredible potential of Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) and Nature-based Solutions (NbS).
          To build a nature-positive future, we must integrate natural climate solutions into
          decision-making. Naturebase will identify effective government initiatives and public
          policies that support nature by linking existing government initiatives to specific
          geographies, including legislation, subsidies, budget allocations, and incentive programs.

          Science has shown the immense potential of natural climate solutions, but we know
          comparatively little about what impedes action. Naturebase will leverage from the largest
          ever global survey of these feasibility constraints such as lack of access to capital,
          insufficient training, perverse incentives or market forces, or governance barriers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding where these constraints occur and how they relate to implementation will
          guide decision-makers to target investment where interventions are most likely to achieve
          near-term climate change mitigation at the lowest cost to society. But it will also
          provide the information necessary for developing targeted interventions that can remove
          the most persistent barriers over the longer term.
