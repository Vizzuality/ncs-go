          We are developing the science to address two critical questions that must be answered to
          realize the potential of Natural Climate Solutions: Precisely where should we focus our
          efforts, and exactly what interventions have the highest likelihood of success? Research
          has shown how much nature can do: forests, agricultural lands, grasslands and wetlands
          cost-effectively capture 11 billion metric tons of CO2e per year, a full third of the
          solution needed to stabilize our climate by 2030.{' '}
        </p>

        <p>
          NCS are divided into over twenty different pathways to action, including avoided forest
          conversion, climate-smart forestry, reforestation and agroforestry, regenerative
          agriculture, and protection or restoration of grasslands, peatlands and coastal wetlands.
          Naturebase will map out of these pathways at high resolution, specifying where the largest
          climate mitigation opportunities occur, and under what conditions. It will highlight
          operational protocols and methodologies to ensure projects achieve measurable climate
          mitigation. And it will showcase on-the-ground research that fills critical knowledge
          gaps.

          Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) can deliver benefits to biodiversity, human adaptation to
          climate change, and human well-being in addition to their carbon mitigation benefit.
          Understanding how these additional benefits vary by NCS intervention, local context,
          population, country, and other factors is critical to identifying areas where NCS
          implementation can have the greatest outcomes and tradeoffs. We are systematically
          identifying the evidence-base on additional NCS benefits, generating new evidence on the
          biodiversity, adaptation, and human well-being co-benefits for NCS interventions.
        </p>
        <p>We are doing this through multiple interrelated projects including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A machine learning-based systematic evidence map of more than 800,000 papers on the
            biodiversity and human well-being co-benefits of NCS
          </li>
          <li>
            Estimating impacts of peatland restoration, agroforestry, and mangrove restoration and
            protection in on biodiversity and human well-being in demonstration landscapes
          </li>
          <li>
            Estimating the global contribution of several NCS pathways to human adaptation, and
            biodiversity through ecosystem service and landscape connectivity models, respectively.{' '}
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, these products provide foundational evidence needed by decision-makers to
          determine whether and how NCS implementation serves as an instrumental tool in advancing
          the well-being of both nature and people.

          We have a unique opportunity to drive significant political commitment and finance towards
          sustainable land-use on a livable planet. Governments have the power to unlock the
          incredible potential of Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) and Nature-based Solutions (NbS).
          To build a nature-positive future, we must integrate natural climate solutions into
          decision-making. Naturebase will identify effective government initiatives and public
          policies that support nature by linking existing government initiatives to specific
          geographies, including legislation, subsidies, budget allocations, and incentive programs.

          Science has shown the immense potential of natural climate solutions, but we know
          comparatively little about what impedes action. Naturebase will leverage from the largest
          ever global survey of these feasibility constraints such as lack of access to capital,
          insufficient training, perverse incentives or market forces, or governance barriers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding where these constraints occur and how they relate to implementation will
          guide decision-makers to target investment where interventions are most likely to achieve
          near-term climate change mitigation at the lowest cost to society. But it will also
          provide the information necessary for developing targeted interventions that can remove
          the most persistent barriers over the longer term.

          Building on the expertise of on-the-ground practitioners Naturebase will highlight a
          growing natural climate solutions learning network, designed to field test and evaluate
          high-impact strategies that can be scaled and replicated around the world. The network
          brings together field staff and scientists from existing projects in diverse ecosystems.
          Each project is a means to field test the impact and efficacy of different approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Local project teams will work with the prototyping team to measure mitigation and evaluate
          project impact, assess feasibility, ensure equitable implementation, and identify
          opportunities to scale. The network will also provide a cross-project community of
          learning and collaboration, and a constant feedback loop to improve implementation through
          adaptive management. Data and case studies from pilot projects will be available to
          researchers and decision-makers around the world through the development of innovative
          tools.

          Natural climate solutions (NCS) practitioners must take bold steps to ensure that projects
          not only avoid adverse human rights impacts but actively promote Indigenous People and
          Local Communities (IPLC) rights, self-determination, well-being, and equity, including
          full entitlement to benefits. The broader NCS community must strive to do this not only
          because it is the right thing to do, but also because it will ensure the long-term
          viability and sustainability of NCS projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturebase will showcase a new NCS Human Rights Toolset specially designed to help screen
          existing and proposed NCS projects for ongoing or potential future risks to human rights
          and self-determination. Because NCS is rooted in land use strategies, and IPLCs steward a
          disproportionate amount of the NCS opportunity globally, Naturebase intends to both
          respect and support IPLCs in their own pursuit of informed and self-determined climate and
          land use decision-making.

  //         Building on research to target NCS investments where interventions are most likely to

  //         will demonstrate how much restoration, protection, and management activities could reduce
  //         climate change at various carbon market prices. Using marginal abatement cost (MACC)
  //         analysis we can provide several pieces of useful information. For one, MACC curves
  //         indicate the total mitigation that can be achieved at up to any given unit cost ($ tCO2e).

  //       <p>
  //         This is important for identifying projects whose unit cost of mitigation (i.e., MACC) is
  //         equal to or less than a given carbon price. These MACC curves are useful because they
  //         allow comparisons among individual NCS activity and between NCS and other mitigation
  //         options, both with respect to mitigation potential and costs. In addition to facilitating
  //         comparison among mitigation options, information about the MACC of available mitigation
  //         options â€“both NCS and non-NCSâ€“ allows identification of the cost- effective mitigation
  //         portfolio for any desired total level of mitigation.
